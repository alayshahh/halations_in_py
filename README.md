Halations are cool, but my camera doesn't do them out of the box. I also dont want to buy a filter. Python is free and easy to use.

## What exactly is a halation?

Halations are a reminant of film photography. Halations occur when light from a bright source penetrates the film emulsion layer (the light sensitive coating on film made of gelatin and silver halide crystals) and bounces off the film base back on to the emulsion layer. The scattered light creates a halo effect on the light source.
